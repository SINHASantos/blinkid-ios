# Requirements

SDK package contains `BlinkID` framework, `BlinkIDUX` package and one or more sample apps that demonstrate their integration. The `BlinkID` framework can be deployed on iOS 15.0 or later and `BlinkIDUX` package can be deployed on iOS 16.0 or later. The framework and package support Swift projects.

> Both `BlinkID` and `BlinkIDUX` are **dynamic packages**

> This project is designed with Swift 6, leveraging the latest concurrency features to ensure efficient, and modern application performance.

> `BlinkIDUX` is built with full support for SwiftUI, enabling seamless integration of declarative user interfaces with modern, responsive design principles.

## Requirements

| SDK        | Platform       | Installation                                    | Minimum Swift Version | Type    |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| BlinkID    | iOS 15.0+      | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager) | 5.10 / Xcode 15.3     | Dynamic |
| BlinkIDUX  | iOS 16.0+      | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager) | 5.10 / Xcode 15.3     | Dynamic |


# <a name="quick-start"></a> Quick Start

In this section, you will initialize the SDK, create a capture session, and submit the images for either server-side or client-side verification, resulting in a fraud verdict and a detailed analysis of the document images.

## <a name="getting-started-with-the-blinkid-sdk"></a> Getting started with the BlinkID SDK

This Quick Start guide will get you up and performing document scanning as quickly as possible. All steps described in this guide are required for the integration.

This guide closely follows the BlinkID app in the Samples folder of this repository. We highly recommend you try to run the sample app. The sample app should compile and run on your device.

The source code of the sample app can be used as a reference during the integration.

### <a name="integration"></a> Integration

To integrate the BlinkID SDK into your iOS project, you'll need to:

1. Obtain a valid license key from the [Microblink dashboard](https://developer.microblink.com)
2. Add the SDK framework to your project

#### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding BlinkID and BlinkIDUX as a dependency are as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

##### **BlinkID**

We provide a URL to the public package repository that you can add in Xcode:

```shell
https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios
```

##### **BlinkIDUX**

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "8001.0.0"))
]
```

Normally you'll want to depend on the `BlinkIDUX` target:

```swift
.product(name: "BlinkIDUX", package: "blinkid-ios")
```

> The package manifest is named `BlinkIDUX`, but Swift Package Manager identifies a package by its repository name, so the `package:` argument is `"blinkid-ios"`.

> `BlinkIDUX` has a binary target dependency on `BlinkID`, so **use this package only if you are also using our UX.**

You can see dependency in our `Package.swift`:

```swift
.binaryTarget(
    name: "BlinkID",
    path: "Frameworks/BlinkID.xcframework"
)
```

#### <a name="manual-integration"></a> Manual integration

If you prefer not to use Swift Package Manager, you can integrate BlinkID and BlinkIDUX into your project manually.

##### **BlinkID**

[Download](https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios/releases) latest release (Download `BlinkID.xcframework.zip` file or clone this repository).

- Copy `BlinkID.xcframework` to your project folder.

- In your Xcode project, open the Project navigator. Drag the `BlinkID.xcframework` file to your project, ideally in the Frameworks group.

- Since `BlinkID.xcframework` is a dynamic framework, you also need to add it to embedded binaries section in General settings of your target and choose option `Embed & Sign`.

##### **BlinkIDUX**

- Open up Terminal, cd into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

```shell
$ git init
```

- Add BlinkIDUX as a git submodule by running the following command:

```shell
$ git submodule add https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios.git
```

To add a local Swift package as a dependency in Xcode:
	1.	Go to your Xcode project.
	2.	Select your project in the Project Navigator.
	3.	Go to the Package Dependencies tab under your project settings.
	4.	Click the ”+” button to add a new dependency.
	5.	In the dialog that appears, select the “Add Local…” option at the bottom left.
	6.	Navigate to the folder containing your local Swift package and select it.

This will add the local Swift package as a dependency to your Xcode project.

> `BlinkIDUX` has a binary target dependency on `BlinkID`, so **use this package only if you are also using our UX.**

#### <a name="ai-coding-assistants"></a> AI coding assistants

If you integrate with the help of an AI coding assistant, install the BlinkID **skills** — packaged instructions that teach the assistant this SDK's API, so it writes integration code against the real types instead of guessing.

Download `BlinkID-ux-skill.zip` and/or `BlinkID-core-skill.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios/releases) and unzip them into your project:

```shell
mkdir -p .claude/skills
unzip BlinkID-ux-skill.zip   -d .claude/skills   # scanning screen, custom UX, theming
unzip BlinkID-core-skill.zip -d .claude/skills   # headless / Direct API, results, resources
```

Install the UX skill if you use `BlinkIDUX`, the Core skill if you process images without our camera UI, or both. The skills are versioned with the SDK — re-download them when you upgrade.

### <a name="initiating-the-blinkid-process"></a> Initiating the document scanning process

In files in which you want to use the functionality of the SDK place the import directive.

```swift
import BlinkID
```

1. Initialize the SDK with your license key:

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: "your-license-key",
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(download: true)
)

let sdk = try await BlinkIDSdk.createBlinkIDSdk(withSettings: settings)
```

> **Migration note:** the standalone `downloadResources` initializer argument has been replaced by a grouped `resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig`. See [SDK Settings](#sdk-settings) for the full mapping.

2. Create a capture session:

```swift
let session = await sdk.createScanningSession()
```

3. Process images and handle results:

```swift
let scanResult = await session.process(inputImage: capturedImage)
if scanResult.processResult?.inputImageAnalysisResult.processingStatus == .success { 
    let finalResult = await session.getResult()
}
```

### <a name="initiating-blinkid-ux"></a> Initiating BlinkID UX
We provide the BlinkIDUX package, which encapsulates all the necessary logic for the document scanning process, streamlining integration into your app.

In files in which you want to use the functionality of the SDK place the import directive.

```swift
import BlinkIDUX
```

1. Initialize the BlinkIDAnalyzer:
- Begin by creating an instance of the BlinkIDAnalyzer after initializing the capture session:

```swift
let analyzer = await BlinkIDAnalyzer(sdk: sdk)
```

2. Display the BlinkIDUXView in SwiftUI:
- Add the BlinkIDUXView to your SwiftUI view hierarchy using the BlinkIDAnalyzer:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        BlinkIDUXView(analyzer: analyzer) { scanningResultState in }
    }
}
```

3. Access results:

```swift
BlinkIDUXView(analyzer: analyzer) { scanningResultState in
    if let scanningResult = scanningResultState.scanningResult {
        // do sth with result
    } else {
        // or here if there's no result
    }
}
```

4. You can also pass ScanningUXSettings as a view modifier:

```swift
BlinkIDUXView(analyzer: analyzer) { scanningResultState in
}
.uxSettings(uxSettings)
```

5. Observe per-frame processing with the `onFrameProcessResult` view modifier:
- This modifier delivers a `FrameProcessResultHandle` on every processed camera frame (and once when the hard step timeout fires). Use `resultCompleteness` to inspect how much data has been extracted so far and decide whether to advance the scanning session to the next step:

```swift
BlinkIDUXView(analyzer: analyzer) { scanningResultState in
}
.onFrameProcessResult { handle in
    guard let completeness = handle.processResult?.resultCompleteness else { return }
    // inspect completeness and decide whether to advance to the next step
}
```

> **Important:** Do not use `BlinkIDScanningResult` for this decision. `ResultCompleteness` is lightweight, always available per frame, and describes extraction status and presence requirements without constructing a full result.

> **Warning:** This handle is delivered on the frame processing context, not on the main thread. Dispatch any UI work to `DispatchQueue.main` or `@MainActor` as needed.

### <a name="blinkid"></a> Initiating BlinkID

BlinkID is a powerful document scanning solution designed to enhance the security and accuracy of document scanning processes.

## <a name="BlinkID-components"></a> BlinkID Components

### BlinkIDSdk

The `BlinkIDSdk` class serves as the main entry point for document scanning functionality. It manages SDK initialization, resource downloading, and session creation.

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: "your-license-key",
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(download: true)
)

do {
    let sdk = try await BlinkIDSdk.createBlinkIDSdk(withSettings: settings)
    let session = await sdk.createScanningSession()
    // Use the session for document scanning
} catch {
    // Handle initialization errors
}
```

### BlinkIDSession

`BlinkIDSession` is a Swift class that manages document scanning operations, providing a robust interface for capturing, processing, and validating documents through image analysis and scanning.

The `BlinkIDSession` class serves as the primary controller for document scanning workflows, handling various aspects such as:
- Image processing and analysis
- Session lifecycle management
- Result generation and processing

#### Initialization

```swift
let sdk = try await BlinkIDSdk.createBlinkIDSdk(withSettings: settings)
let BlinkIDSession = await sdk.createScanningSession()
```

Creates a new capture session with specified settings and resource path configurations.

#### Key Features

##### Cancel Processing

```swift
public func cancelActiveProcessing()
```

Immediately terminates any ongoing processing operations. This method can be called from any context and is useful for handling user cancellations or session aborts.

##### Image Processing

```swift
@ProcessingActor
public func process(inputImage: InputImage) -> FrameProcessResult
```

Processes an input image and provides detailed analysis results. This method:
- Analyzes the provided image according to session settings
- Returns a `FrameProcessResult` containing analysis results and completion status
- Must be executed within the ProcessingActor context

##### Result Retrieval

```swift
@ProcessingActor
public func getResult() -> BlinkIDScanningResult
```

Retrieves the final results of the capture session, including:
- All captured images
- Session metadata
- Must be called within the ProcessingActor context

#### Usage Example

```swift
/// Processes a camera frame for document analysis.
/// - Parameter image: The camera frame to analyze
public func analyze(image: CameraFrame) async {
    guard !paused else { return }
    let inputImage = InputImage(cameraFrame: image)
    
    let result = await BlinkIDSession.process(inputImage: inputImage)

    if result.processResult?.inputImageAnalysisResult.processingStatus == .success {
        Task { @ProcessingActor in
            let sessionResult = session.getResult()
            // Finish scanning
        }
    }
}
```

Please refer to our `BlinkIDAnalyzer` in the BlinkIDUX module for implementation details and guidance on its usage.

#### Integration Considerations

1. Actor Isolation: Many methods must be called within the `ProcessingActor` context to ensure thread safety
2. Session Management: Each session maintains its own unique identifier and state
3. Resource Management: Proper initialization with valid resource paths is crucial for operation
4. Cancellation Support: Operations can be cancelled at any time using `cancelActiveProcessing()`

The class implements the `Sendable` protocol and uses actor isolation (`@ProcessingActor`) to ensure thread-safe operations in concurrent environments.

- Ensure proper error handling for processing operations
- Consider implementing timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Maintain proper lifecycle management of the session
- Handle results appropriately according to your application's needs

### FrameProcessResult
`FrameProcessResult` is the top-level value returned from processing a single camera frame. It carries either a successful `ProcessResult` or a `SessionError`.
- `processResult`: `ProcessResult?` - The result of the frame processing, or `nil` if processing did not produce one.
- `sessionError`: `SessionError?` - The error that occurred during processing, if any.

### ScanningSettings

`ScanningSettings` is the central configuration for how a document is scanned. It groups together the individual extraction modules — document capture, MRZ, barcode, and VIZ — along with the data-matching tolerance. It's passed to `BlinkIDSessionSettings`, which in turn configures a scanning session.

Each module is optional. A `nil` module means that module is disabled; a non-`nil` module means it runs with the supplied settings. By default every module is enabled with its standard settings.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `documentCaptureModule` | `DocumentCaptureModuleSettings?` | `.init()` | Document detection, image extraction, and image-quality validation |
| `mrzModule` | `MrzModuleSettings?` | `.init()` | Machine Readable Zone detection and parsing |
| `barcodeModule` | `BarcodeModuleSettings?` | `.init()` | 1D/2D barcode detection and data extraction |
| `vizModule` | `VizModuleSettings?` | `.init()` | Visual Inspection Zone field extraction |
| `maxAllowedMismatchesPerField` | `Int` | `0` | Max characters per field that may differ during data matching across sides |

```swift
let settings = ScanningSettings(
    documentCaptureModule: DocumentCaptureModuleSettings(),
    mrzModule: MrzModuleSettings(),
    barcodeModule: BarcodeModuleSettings(),
    vizModule: VizModuleSettings(),
    maxAllowedMismatchesPerField: 0
)
```

To disable a module entirely, pass `nil`:

```swift
// Capture-only configuration with no barcode scanning
let settings = ScanningSettings(barcodeModule: nil)
```

---

### DocumentCaptureModuleSettings

Responsible for the initial document detection, image extraction (face, document, signature), and image-quality validation (blur, glare, lighting, tilt, hand occlusion).

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cropType` | `InputImageCropType` | `.notCropped` | How the input image is treated for document localization and perspective correction. `.cropped` and `.unknown` apply to `Photo` source only (validation error if used with `Video`). See [InputImageCropType](#inputimagecroptype). |
| `unsupportedDocumentsAllowed` | `Bool` | `false` | Allow processing of documents classified as `OTHER`. |
| `secondSideWithNoExtractableDataSkipped` | `Bool` | `true` | Stop after the front side when the back has no extractable data. If `false`, the back is still captured. |
| `passportDataPageScanOnly` | `Bool` | `true` | Scan only the passport data page (the one with the MRZ). If `false`, a second page may be required for some passports. |
| `faceImageExtractionEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Extract the document's face image when present. |
| `faceImagePresenceMandatory` | `Bool` | `false` | Require a face image. In Automatic mode the side with the face must be scanned first. |
| `inputImageReturnEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Return the input images in the result. Significantly increases memory use. |
| `documentImageReturnEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Return the cropped document image in the result. |
| `inputImageMargin` | `Float?` | `0.02` | Minimum margin (0.0–1.0) between the image edge and the document. `Video` source only; ignored when `cropType == .cropped`. |
| `dotsPerInch` | `DPI` | `250` | DPI for cropped document, face, and signature images. Allowed range 100–400. |
| `extensionFactor` | `Float` | `0.0` | Extension factor (0.0–1.0) for the cropped document image. Document images only. |
| `blurSensitivityLevel` | `SensitivityLevel` | `.mid` | Sensitivity of blur detection. |
| `imageWithBlurRejected` | `Bool?` | `true` | Reject blurry images (sets `ProcessingStatus` to `imagePreprocessingFailed`). If `false`, blur is reported but processed. |
| `glareSensitivityLevel` | `SensitivityLevel` | `.mid` | Sensitivity of glare detection. |
| `imageWithGlareRejected` | `Bool?` | `true` | Reject images with glare. If `false`, glare is reported but processed. |
| `tiltSensitivityLevel` | `SensitivityLevel` | `.mid` | Sensitivity of allowed document tilt. |
| `imageWithPoorLightingRejected` | `Bool` | `true` | Reject images that are `tooBright` or `tooDark`. |
| `imageWithHandOcclusionRejected` | `Bool?` | `true` | Reject images occluded by a hand. Applies only when `cropType != .cropped`. |
| `inputImageSelectionStrategy` | `InputImageSelectionStrategy` | `.balanced` | Strategy for selecting the best image from a pool of stable frames. `Video` source only. See [InputImageSelectionStrategy](#inputimageselectionstrategy). |

> `Bool?` fields use `nil` to defer to SDK behavior, distinct from an explicit `true`/`false`.

---

### MrzModuleSettings

Handles detection and parsing of the Machine Readable Zone found on passports, visas, and identity cards.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `presenceMandatory` | `Bool` | `false` | Require an MRZ regardless of document rules. In Single mode it must be on the scanned side; in Automatic mode on one of the scanned sides. |

If a timeout advances the flow and an MRZ was detected but not extractable, the presence requirement is treated as fulfilled — MRZ extraction won't block completion on the next side.

---

### BarcodeModuleSettings

Manages detection and data extraction from 1D and 2D barcode formats (PDF417, QR, and various retail codes). Can run standalone or alongside document capture.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `presenceMandatory` | `Bool` | `false` | Require a barcode. Single mode: on the scanned side. Automatic mode: on one of the scanned sides. |
| `barcodeImageReturnEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Return the barcode image. DPI and extension factor do not affect it. |
| `pdf417ScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `true` | Enable PDF417 scanning. |
| `qrScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `true` | Enable QR scanning. |
| `upceScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable UPC-E. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `upcaScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable UPC-A. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `code128ScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable Code-128. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `code39ScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable Code-39. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `ean8ScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable EAN-8. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `ean13ScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable EAN-13. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `itfScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable ITF. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `dataMatrixScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable DataMatrix. Only if document capture is disabled. |
| `aztecScanningEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enable Aztec. Only if document capture is disabled. |

> **Important:** The analyzer model flags a barcode as "present" when it detects either a PDF417 or a QR code, without distinguishing between them at that stage. If `pdf417ScanningEnabled` is on but `qrScanningEnabled` is off (or vice versa), the analyzer can trigger on the other type and hang. Keep `pdf417ScanningEnabled` and `qrScanningEnabled` enabled together.

---

### VizModuleSettings

Extracts data from the document's visual fields. Supports character validation, signature image extraction, and aggregation across multiple video frames.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `presenceMandatory` | `Bool` | `false` | Require VIZ. Single mode scans the front of supported documents only. Automatic mode is unaffected (front then back). |
| `signatureImageExtractionEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Extract the signature image where supported by document rules. |
| `characterValidationEnabled` | `Bool` | `true` | Allow only results with expected characters per field. An invalid character yields `ProcessingStatus.invalidCharactersFound`. Improves accuracy. |
| `resultAggregationEnabled` | `Bool?` | `true` | Aggregate data across frames. Disabling yields higher-quality images but slower scanning. `Video` source only; ignored for `Photo`. |

If a front-side VIZ isn't fully extracted before a timeout advances the flow, extraction continues on the back side when present.

---

### Supporting types

#### <a name="inputimagecroptype"></a> InputImageCropType

Controls how `DocumentCaptureModuleSettings.cropType` treats the input image with respect to document localization and perspective correction.

- `notCropped` — default. The image is treated as raw and runs through the full detection and perspective-correction pipeline. Applicable to both `Photo` and `Video` sources.
- `unknown` — the image may be cropped, but there's no guarantee. The SDK first attempts to treat it as cropped and, if extraction fails, falls back to the normal detect-and-crop pipeline. `Photo` source only.
- `cropped` — the image is already cropped and perspective-corrected. `Photo` source only.

> Using `unknown` or `cropped` with a `Video` input source causes a validation error.

#### <a name="inputimageselectionstrategy"></a> InputImageSelectionStrategy

Controls how `DocumentCaptureModuleSettings.inputImageSelectionStrategy` picks the best frame from a pool of stable input images. A larger pool improves the chance of a high-quality capture but can add a slight delay. `Video` source only.

- `singleImage` — selects the first acceptable stable image.
- `optimizeForSpeed` — faster, but may pick a lower-quality image (smaller pool considered).
- `balanced` — default. Trade-off between speed and quality.
- `optimizeForQuality` — slower; considers a larger pool to select a higher-quality image.

#### SensitivityLevel

Configures detection sensitivity for blur, glare, and tilt.

- `off` — detection disabled
- `low` — less sensitive
- `mid` — balanced (default for quality checks)
- `high` — most sensitive

#### DPI

A type alias for `UInt16`, used by `dotsPerInch`.

---

### Putting it together

`ScanningSettings` is supplied via `BlinkIDSessionSettings`, which is what a scanning session actually consumes:

```swift
let sessionSettings = BlinkIDSessionSettings(
    inputImageSource: .video,
    scanningMode: .automatic,
    scanningSettings: ScanningSettings(
        documentCaptureModule: DocumentCaptureModuleSettings(
            faceImageExtractionEnabled: true,
            documentImageReturnEnabled: true
        ),
        mrzModule: MrzModuleSettings(presenceMandatory: true),
        barcodeModule: BarcodeModuleSettings(),
        vizModule: VizModuleSettings()
    ),
    stepTimeoutDuration: 60.0,
    inactivityTimeoutDuration: 10.0
)
```

### <a name="redaction"></a> Redaction

Redaction lets you anonymize sensitive data from a scanned document before the result is finalized. You can apply redaction uniformly, or vary it per document by implementing a `RedactionSettingsResolver`.

#### RedactionSettings

Describes what gets redacted from a scanned document.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `RedactionMode` | `.fullResult` | The mode of redaction applied to the document. |
| `fields` | `[FieldType]` | — | The specific fields to redact. |
| `documentNumberRedactionSettings` | `DocumentNumberRedactionSettings?` | `nil` | Partial redaction of the document number. See [DocumentNumberRedactionSettings](#documentnumberredactionsettings). |
| `redactMrz` | `Bool` | `false` | If `true`, the entire MRZ result is redacted. |
| `redactBarcode` | `Bool` | `false` | If `true`, the entire barcode result is redacted. |

```swift
let redaction = RedactionSettings(
    mode: .fullResult,
    fields: [.additionalAddressInformation, .additionalPersonalIdNumber],
    documentNumberRedactionSettings: DocumentNumberRedactionSettings(
        prefixDigitsVisible: 0,
        suffixDigitsVisible: 4
    ),
    redactMrz: true,
    redactBarcode: false
)
```

##### getDefaultRedactionSettings(for:)

Returns the SDK's built-in default `RedactionSettings` for a given document class, or `nil` if none apply. Use it as a starting point when you want to tweak — rather than fully replace — the defaults for a document class.

```swift
static func getDefaultRedactionSettings(for classInfo: DocumentClassInfo) -> RedactionSettings?
```

#### DocumentNumberRedactionSettings

Controls partial redaction of the document number, keeping a chosen number of digits visible at each end.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `prefixDigitsVisible` | `UInt8` | `0` | How many digits at the **start** of the document number remain visible after redaction. |
| `suffixDigitsVisible` | `UInt8` | `0` | How many digits at the **end** of the document number remain visible after redaction. |

```swift
// Keep the last 4 digits visible, redact the rest
let docNumber = DocumentNumberRedactionSettings(prefixDigitsVisible: 0, suffixDigitsVisible: 4)
```

#### RedactionSettingsResolver

A `Sendable` protocol for supplying per-document redaction behavior. The SDK invokes the resolver immediately before the scanning result is finalized, passing the detected `DocumentClassInfo`. Return custom `RedactionSettings`, or `nil` to fall back to the SDK's defaults for that document class.

```swift
public protocol RedactionSettingsResolver: Sendable {
    func resolveRedactionSettings(classInfo: DocumentClassInfo) -> RedactionSettings?
}
```

A common pattern is to start from the SDK defaults and adjust only specific fields:

```swift
struct MyResolver: RedactionSettingsResolver {
    func resolveRedactionSettings(classInfo: DocumentClassInfo) -> RedactionSettings? {
        switch (classInfo.documentType, classInfo.country) {
        case (.alienId, .malaysia):
            var defaults = RedactionSettings.getDefaultRedactionSettings(for: classInfo)
            defaults?.fields = [.additionalAddressInformation, .additionalPersonalIdNumber]
            return defaults
        default:
            return nil // use SDK defaults
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Returning `nil` applies the SDK defaults automatically — you only need `getDefaultRedactionSettings(for:)` when you want to *modify* the defaults, not accept them as-is. Because the resolver may be invoked from any actor or task context in the scanning pipeline, conforming types must be `Sendable`.

> `RedactionMode`, `FieldType`, `AlphabetType`, and `DocumentClassInfo` are defined elsewhere in the SDK; refer to the [API reference](#additional-info) for their full set of cases.

### ProcessResult
`ProcessResult` is a Swift structure that encapsulates the complete results of a document scanning process, combining frame analysis with completion status information.
- `inputImageAnalysisResult`: `InputImageAnalysisResult` - Detailed analysis of the processed frame (detection, quality, document classification).
- `resultCompleteness`: `ResultCompleteness` - Describes how much of the document's data has been extracted so far.

#### Key Features

##### InputImageAnalysisResult
Contains detailed analysis results for a single frame in the verification process, including processing status, document detection and classification, image quality checks (blur, glare, lighting, moiré, hand occlusion), and the lists of missing, extracted, invalid, and extra fields.

Notable fields include:
- `processingStatus`: `ProcessingStatus` - Overall processing status for the frame
- `documentDetectionStatus`: `DetectionStatus` - The status of document detection
- `documentLocation`: `Quadrilateral?` - The location of the detected document within the image, or `nil` if not available
- `documentOrientation`: `DocumentOrientation` - The orientation of the detected document
- `documentRotation`: `DocumentRotation` - The rotation of the detected document
- `documentClassInfo`: `DocumentClassInfo` - Information about the document class (country, region, type)

##### DetectionStatus
An enumeration representing the status of document detection during scanning.
- `failed`: Detection has failed
- `success`: Document has been detected
- `cameraTooFar`: Document has been detected but the camera is too far from the document
- `cameraTooClose`: Document has been detected but the camera is too close to the document
- `cameraAngleTooSteep`: Document has been detected but the camera's angle is too steep
- `documentTooCloseToCameraEdge`: Document has been detected but the document is too close to the camera edge
- `documentPartiallyVisible`: Only part of the document is visible

##### ScanningStatus
An enumeration that defines the possible statuses that can occur during the scanning operation, specifically for managing the progress of scanning sides and the entire document. Retrieved via `session.getScanningStatus()`.
- `scanningSideInProgress`: A document side is currently being scanned
- `scanningBarcodeInProgress`: The barcode is currently being scanned
- `sideScanned`: A document side has been scanned
- `documentScanned`: The entire document has been scanned
- `cancelled`: Scanning was cancelled

##### ResultCompleteness
A structure tracking the completeness of the extraction process for a scanned document. It indicates whether specific components — VIZ, MRZ, barcode, and images — have been successfully extracted. All properties are optional and `nil` when not applicable to the scanned document.
- `viz`: `[VizCompleteness?]?` - Completeness of VIZ extraction for one or more VIZ models
- `mrz`: `MrzCompleteness?` - Completeness of MRZ extraction
- `barcode`: `BarcodeCompleteness?` - Completeness of barcode extraction
- `faceImage`: `ImageCompleteness?` - Completeness of face image extraction
- `signatureImage`: `ImageCompleteness?` - Completeness of signature image extraction
- `barcodeImage`: `ImageCompleteness?` - Completeness of barcode image extraction
- `documentImages`: `[ImageCompleteness]?` - Completeness of document image extraction (one or more pages/sides)

##### Point

Represents a 2D point in the coordinate system.

- `x`: `Int32` - X-coordinate
- `y`: `Int32` - Y-coordinate

##### Quadrilateral

Represents a four-sided polygon defined by its corner points.

- `upperLeft`: `Point`
- `upperRight`: `Point`
- `lowerRight`: `Point`
- `lowerLeft`: `Point`

#### Usage Example

```swift
if result.processResult?.inputImageAnalysisResult.processingStatus == .success {
    Task { @ProcessingActor in
        let sessionResult = session.getResult()
        // Finish scanning
    }
}
```

#### Integration Considerations

1. Error Handling
   - Monitor `documentDetectionStatus` for potential capture issues
   - Check `processingStatus` for overall processing success

2. Quality Control
   - Use `blurDetectionStatus` and `glareDetectionStatus` to ensure optimal image quality

3. Progress Tracking
   - Use `ResultCompleteness` to track extraction progress
   - Use `session.getScanningStatus()` to monitor overall process state
   - Handle partial completions appropriately

All types conform to the `Sendable` protocol, ensuring thread-safe operations in concurrent environments.

##### Best practices

1. Always check `session.getScanningStatus() == .documentScanned` before concluding the scanning process
2. Implement proper error handling for all possible `DetectionStatus` cases
3. Monitor quality indicators (blur, glare, moire) for optimal capture conditions
4. Implement appropriate user feedback based on `processingStatus` and `documentDetectionStatus`

### InputImage

`InputImage` is a Swift class that wraps either a UIImage or camera frame for processing in the document scanning system.

#### Initialization

```swift
// Create from UIImage
public init(uiImage: UIImage, regionOfInterest: RegionOfInterest = RegionOfInterest())

// Create from camera frame
public init(cameraFrame: CameraFrame)
```

#### Key Features

##### RegionOfInterest

A structure that defines the area of interest within an image for processing.

- `x`: `Float` - X-coordinate (normalized between 0 and 1)
- `y`: `Float` - Y-coordinate (normalized between 0 and 1)
- `width`: `Float` - Width (normalized between 0 and 1)
- `height`: `Float` - Height (normalized between 0 and 1)

##### CameraFrameVideoOrientation

An enumeration representing the device orientation during frame capture.

- `portrait`: Device in normal upright position
- `portraitUpsideDown`: Device held upside down
- `landscapeRight`: Device rotated 90 degrees clockwise
- `landscapeLeft`: Device rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise

##### CameraFrame

A structure representing a complete camera frame with its metadata.

- `buffer`: `CMSampleBuffer` - Raw camera buffer containing image data
- `roi`: `RegionOfInterest` - Region of interest within the frame
- `orientation`: `CameraFrameVideoOrientation` - Camera orientation
- `width`: `Int` - Frame width in pixels (computed property)
- `height`: `Int` - Frame height in pixels (computed property)

```swift
public init(
    buffer: CMSampleBuffer, 
    roi: RegionOfInterest = RegionOfInterest(), 
    orientation: CameraFrameVideoOrientation = .portrait
)
```

```swift
func processCameraOutput(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer) {
    let frame = CameraFrame(
        buffer: sampleBuffer,
        roi: RegionOfInterest(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1.0, height: 1.0),
        orientation: .portrait
    )

    let inputImage = InputImage(cameraFrame: frame)
}
```

#### Usage Example

```swift
// Creating from UIImage
let inputImage1 = InputImage(
    uiImage: documentImage,
    regionOfInterest: RegionOfInterest(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1.0, height: 1.0)
)

// Creating from camera frame
let inputImage2 = InputImage(cameraFrame: cameraFrame)
```

#### Integration Considerations

1. Image Source Handling
   - Choose appropriate initialization method based on image source (UIImage or camera frame)
   - Consider memory management implications when working with camera frames
   - Handle orientation conversions properly

2. Region of Interest
   - Use normalized coordinates (0-1) for region of interest
   - Validate region boundaries to prevent out-of-bounds issues
   - Consider UI implications when setting custom regions

3. Performance Optimization
   - Minimize frame buffer copies
   - Consider frame rate and processing overhead
   - Handle memory efficiently when processing multiple frames

- `InputImage` and related types conform to the `Sendable` protocol
- `CameraFrame` is marked as `@unchecked Sendable` due to buffer handling
- Care should be taken when sharing frames across threads

###### Best Practices

1. Memory Management
   - Release camera frames promptly after processing
   - Avoid unnecessary copies of large image buffers
   - Use appropriate autorelease pool when processing multiple frames

2. Error Handling
   - Check frame dimensions before processing
   - Handle invalid region of interest parameters
   - Validate image orientation data

3. Performance
   - Process frames in appropriate queue/thread
   - Consider frame rate requirements
   - Optimize region of interest for specific use cases

### <a name="sdk-settings"></a> SDK Settings

`BlinkIDSdkSettings` is the top-level configuration passed to `BlinkIDSdk.createBlinkIDSdk(withSettings:)`. It conforms to two protocols:

- `SdkSettings` — licensing plus base resource configuration (`resourcesConfiguration`).
- `OtaSdkSettings` — over-the-air resource configuration (`otaResourcesConfiguration`).

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `licenseKey` | `String` | — | License key for the native SDK. |
| `licensee` | `String?` | `nil` | Optional licensee string if the license key is not tied to a single application id. |
| `helloLogEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Enables hello-log output. |
| `resourcesConfiguration` | `ResourcesConfig` | `.init()` | Base resource configuration. See [ResourcesConfig](#configuring-resources). |
| `otaResourcesConfiguration` | `OTAResourcesConfig` | `.init()` | Over-the-air resource configuration. See [OTA resources](#ota-resources). |
| `microblinkProxyURL` | `String?` | `nil` | Optional URL for a Microblink proxy. |

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: "your-license-key",
    licensee: nil,
    helloLogEnabled: false,
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(),
    otaResourcesConfiguration: OTAResourcesConfig(),
    microblinkProxyURL: nil
)
```

> **Migration from earlier versions:** resource options used to be set as flat arguments directly on `BlinkIDSdkSettings`. They now live inside `ResourcesConfig`:
>
> | Old (flat argument) | New (`ResourcesConfig`) |
> |---------------------|-------------------------|
> | `downloadResources` | `resourcesConfiguration.download` |
> | `resourceLocalFolder` | `resourcesConfiguration.localFolder` |
> | `bundleURL` | `resourcesConfiguration.bundleUrl` |
>
> ```swift
> // Before
> let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
>     licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
>     downloadResources: true
> )
>
> // After
> let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
>     licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
>     resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(download: true)
> )
> ```
>
> Over-the-air resources are new in this release; see [OTA resources](#ota-resources).

### <a name="resource-management"></a> Resource Management

The SDK supports both downloaded and bundled resources:

- Automatic resource downloading and caching
- Bundle-based resource loading
- Resource validation and verification
- Over-the-air (OTA) resource updates

#### <a name="configuring-resources"></a> Configuring resources

Resource behavior is configured through two objects on `BlinkIDSdkSettings`:

- `resourcesConfiguration` — a `ResourcesConfig` for the base machine-learning resources.
- `otaResourcesConfiguration` — an `OTAResourcesConfig` for over-the-air resource updates.

**`ResourcesConfig`**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `download` | `Bool` | `true` | Whether resources required for on-device image processing are downloaded and cached on first initialization. If `false`, you must package the required resources in your app's assets. |
| `serviceUrl` | `String` | `https://models.cdn.microblink.com/resources` | Host URL for downloaded resources. |
| `localFolder` | `String` | `MLModels` | Name of the subfolder within your app's cache folder where resources are cached. |
| `requestTimeout` | `RequestTimeout` | `.default` | Timeout settings for resource downloads. |
| `bundleUrl` | `URL?` | `nil` | When downloading is disabled, the bundle where the resources reside. |

```swift
let resources = ResourcesConfig(
    download: true,
    serviceUrl: "https://models.cdn.microblink.com/resources",
    localFolder: "MLModels"
)
```

#### <a name="downloading-models"></a> Downloading models

The SDK supports downloading machine learning models from our CDN. Models are automatically retrieved from https://models.cdn.microblink.com/resources when enabled.

To enable model downloads, set `download` to `true` in your `ResourcesConfig`:

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(download: true) // Enable model downloads
)
```

By default, downloaded models are stored in the `MLModels` folder. You can specify a custom storage location using the `localFolder` property of `ResourcesConfig`:

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(
        download: true,
        localFolder: "MyModels"
    )
)
```

Model downloads occur during SDK initialization in the `createBlinkIDSdk` method:

```swift
do {
    let instance = try await BlinkIDSdk.createBlinkIDSdk(withSettings: settings)
} catch let error as ResourceDownloaderError {
    // Handle specific download errors
    if case .noInternetConnection = error {
        // Handle no internet connection
    }
    // Handle other download errors as needed
}
```

The operation may throw a `ResourceDownloaderError` with the following possible cases:

| Error Case | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `invalidURL(String)` | The provided URL for model download is invalid |
| `downloadFailed(Int)` | Download failed with specific HTTP status code |
| `fileNotFound(URL)` | Resource file not found at specified location |
| `hashMismatch(String)` | File hash verification failed |
| `fileAccessError(Error)` | Error accessing file system |
| `cacheDirNotFound` | Cache directory not found |
| `fileCreationError(Error)` | Error creating file |
| `noInternetConnection` | No internet connection available |
| `invalidResponse` | Invalid or unexpected server response |
| `resourceUnavailable` | Requested resource is not available |

The SDK provides built-in components for handling network connectivity states.
`NetworkMonitor` is ready-to-use network connectivity monitor that uses `NWPathMonitor`:

```swift
@MainActor
public class NetworkMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published public var isConnected = true
    public var isOffline: Bool { !isConnected }
    
    public init() {
        setupMonitor()
    }
}
```

`NoInternetView` is a pre-built SwiftUI view for handling offline states:

```swift
public struct NoInternetView: View {
    public init(retryAction: @escaping () -> Void)
}
```

#### <a name="bundling-models"></a> Bundling models

To use bundled models with our SDK, ensure the required model files are included in your app package and set the `download` property of `ResourcesConfig` to `false`. Specify the location of the bundled models using the `bundleUrl` property of `ResourcesConfig`. If you are using the main bundle, you can retrieve its URL as follows:

```swift
let bundle = Bundle.main.bundleURL

let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    resourcesConfiguration: ResourcesConfig(
        download: false,
        bundleUrl: bundle
    )
)
```

#### <a name="ota-resources"></a> Over-the-Air (OTA) resources

In addition to the base resources, the SDK can keep its machine-learning resources up to date **over the air (OTA)**. OTA resources are managed separately from the base resources: they are downloaded from a dedicated host and cached in their own folder, and their update behavior is controlled independently through `OTAResourcesConfig` on `BlinkIDSdkSettings.otaResourcesConfiguration`.

OTA is **enabled by default** — the default `OTAResourcesConfig` checks for updates on initialization and falls back gracefully if an update can't be downloaded.

**`OTAResourcesConfig`**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `checkForUpdates` | `Bool` | `true` | When `true`, the SDK checks for and downloads **updated** OTA resources on init. When `false`, cached resources are reused as-is with no update check — **except** on first run, when resources are missing locally and are downloaded regardless. |
| `strict` | `Bool` | `false` | Controls how a failed OTA download is handled during init. When `true`, initialization **throws** if the OTA update fails to download. When `false`, initialization continues silently and falls back to the currently bundled/cached version. |
| `serviceUrl` | `String` | `https://blinkid-ota.microblink.com` | Host URL for OTA resources. |
| `localFolder` | `String` | `OTAMLModels` | Name of the subfolder within your app's cache folder where OTA resources are cached. |
| `requestTimeout` | `RequestTimeout` | `.default` | Timeout settings for resource downloads. |
| `bundleUrl` | `URL?` | `nil` | When downloading is disabled, the bundle where the OTA resources reside. |

Default configuration (equivalent to passing no `otaResourcesConfiguration`):

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    otaResourcesConfiguration: OTAResourcesConfig() // checkForUpdates: true, strict: false
)
```

Fail hard if an OTA update can't be fetched, instead of silently falling back:

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    otaResourcesConfiguration: OTAResourcesConfig(
        checkForUpdates: true,
        strict: true
    )
)
```

Reuse cached OTA resources without checking for updates (after first run):

```swift
let settings = BlinkIDSdkSettings(
    licenseKey: yourLicenseKey,
    otaResourcesConfiguration: OTAResourcesConfig(checkForUpdates: false)
)
```

> **Notes**
> - **First-run downloads are unavoidable.** `checkForUpdates: false` only suppresses *update* checks; if OTA resources are missing locally they are still downloaded on first run.
> - **`strict: true` changes initialization into a throwing failure path.** Make sure your `createBlinkIDSdk` error handling accounts for a failed OTA download when you enable it.
> - **Base and OTA resources use different hosts and cache folders.** Base resources default to `https://models.cdn.microblink.com/resources` in `MLModels`; OTA resources default to `https://blinkid-ota.microblink.com` in `OTAMLModels`. Keep them separate to avoid collisions.

#### <a name="clearing-cached-resources"></a> Clearing cached resources

The SDK provides two ways to remove cached resources from the device — for example on logout, on "delete my data" flows, when freeing storage, or to force a fresh download on the next initialization. Both clear the base **and** OTA caches and reset the SDK's internal OTA-managed state, and both silently ignore deletion errors so cleanup is never interrupted.

**`deleteCachedResources(resourcesLocalFolder:otaResourcesLocalFolder:)`**

A static utility that deletes the cached resource folders. It does **not** require a running SDK instance and does **not** terminate the SDK — it only removes files.

```swift
// Using the default folder names (MLModels + OTAMLModels)
BlinkIDSdk.deleteCachedResources()

// If you configured custom localFolder names, pass the same names here
BlinkIDSdk.deleteCachedResources(
    resourcesLocalFolder: "MyModels",
    otaResourcesLocalFolder: "MyOTAModels"
)
```

> Because this method locates folders by the names you pass in, make sure they match the `localFolder` values from your `ResourcesConfig` / `OTAResourcesConfig`, or the intended caches won't be removed.

**`terminateBlinkIDSdkAndDeleteCachedResources()`**

Shuts the SDK down **and** removes its cached resources in one step. It reads the resource paths from the currently running instance, deletes both caches, resets OTA-managed state, and then terminates the SDK. It is a **no-op if there is no active instance**, and must be called within the `ProcessingActor` context.

```swift
Task { @ProcessingActor in
    BlinkIDSdk.terminateBlinkIDSdkAndDeleteCachedResources()
}
```

**Which one should I use?**

| | `deleteCachedResources(...)` | `terminateBlinkIDSdkAndDeleteCachedResources()` |
|---|---|---|
| Terminates the SDK | No — deletes files only | Yes — also calls `terminateBlinkIDSdk()` |
| Requires an active instance | No — pure static utility | Yes — no-op when no instance exists |
| How folders are located | From **parameters** (default `MLModels` / `OTAMLModels`) | From the **live instance's** actual resource paths |
| Actor requirement | None — callable from anywhere | Must be called within the `ProcessingActor` context |
| Risk of clearing the wrong folder | Possible if names don't match your config | None — uses the instance's real paths |

- **SDK currently initialized and you want to shut it down and wipe data:** use `terminateBlinkIDSdkAndDeleteCachedResources()`. Since it uses the live instance's paths, it always targets the correct folders regardless of any custom `localFolder`.
- **SDK not running (or already terminated) and you just need to clear files:** use `deleteCachedResources(...)`, passing the same folder names you configured.
- **After clearing caches, the next initialization behaves like a first run** and re-downloads the required resources (subject to your `download` / `checkForUpdates` settings).

## <a name="BlinkID-ux-components"></a> BlinkID UX Components

The BlinkIDUX package is source-available, allowing you to customize and adapt its functionality to suit the specific needs of your project. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the user experience and scanning workflow to align with your app’s design and requirements.

In the next section, we will explain the main components of the BlinkIDUX package and how they work together to simplify document scanning integration.

### BlinkIDAnalyzer

The BlinkIDAnalyzer component provides a robust set of features to streamline and enhance the document scanning process. It includes real-time camera frame analysis for immediate feedback during scanning and asynchronous event streaming to ensure smooth, non-blocking operations. The component supports pause and resume functionality, allowing users to temporarily halt the process and continue seamlessly. With session result handling, developers can easily access and process the final scanning outcomes. Additionally, it offers cancellation support, enabling users to terminate the scanning process at any time. Designed with comprehensive UI event feedback, it delivers clear and actionable guidance to users throughout the scanning workflow.

#### Key Features

##### DocumentSide

An enumeration that represents different sides of a document during the scanning process:

```swift
public enum DocumentSide: Sendable {
    case front    // Front side of the document
    case back     // Back side of the document
    case barcode  // Barcode region of the document
}
```

##### BlinkIDEventStream

An actor that manages the stream of UI events during the document scanning process:

```swift
public actor BlinkIDEventStream: EventStream {
    public func send(_ events: [UIEvent])
    public var stream: AsyncStream<[UIEvent]>
}
```

##### BlinkIDAnalyzer

The main analyzer component that processes camera frames and manages the document scanning workflow:

```swift
public actor BlinkIDAnalyzer: CameraFrameAnalyzer {
    public init(
        sdk: BlinkIDSdk,
        blinkIDSessionSettings: BlinkIDSessionSettings = BlinkIDSessionSettings(inputImageSource: .video),
        eventStream: BlinkIDEventStream
    )
}
```

#### Usage Example

##### Initialization

```swift
// Initialize the analyzer
let analyzer = await BlinkIDAnalyzer(
    sdk: blinkIDSDK
)
```

##### Processing Frames

```swift
// Analyze a camera frame
for await frame in await camera.sampleBuffer {
    await analyzer.analyze(image: CameraFrame(buffer: frame.buffer, roi: roi, orientation: camera.orientation.toCameraFrameVideoOrientation()))
}
```

##### Event Handling

The component provides real-time feedback through an event stream. Events can be observed to update the UI or trigger specific actions based on the scanning progress.

```swift
eventHandlingTask = Task {
    for await events in await analyzer.events.stream {
        if events.contains(.requestDocumentSide(side: .back)) {
            firstSideScanned()
        } else if events.contains(.requestDocumentSide(side: .barcode)) {
            self.setReticleState(.barcode, force: true)
        } else if events.contains(.wrongSide) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Flip the document"))
        } else if events.contains(.tooClose) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Move farther"))
        } else if events.contains(.tooFar) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Move closer"))
        } else if events.contains(.tooCloseToEdge) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Move the document from the edge"))
        } else if events.contains(.tilt) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Keep document parallel with the phone"))
        } else if events.contains(.blur) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Keep document and phone still"))
        } else if events.contains(.glare) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Tilt or move document to remove reflection"))
        } else if events.contains(.notFullyVisible) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Keep document fully visible"))
        } else if events.contains(.occlusion) {
            self.setReticleState(.error("Keep document fully visible"))
        }
    }
}
```

##### Best Practices

When integrating the BlinkIDAnalyzer component, it is essential to follow best practices to ensure a seamless and efficient document scanning experience. By adhering to these guidelines, you can enhance user satisfaction and maintain robust application performance:

- Always handle the event stream to provide real-time user feedback during the scanning process.
- Implement proper error handling to manage scan failures gracefully and guide users effectively.
- Consider implementing timeout handling for production environments to prevent indefinite scanning sessions. Check out our implementation for more details.
- Manage memory efficiently by calling cancel() when the scanner is no longer needed, freeing up resources.
- Handle the pause/resume cycle appropriately to align with app lifecycle events, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### BlinkIDUXModel

The BlinkIDUXModel is a comprehensive view model that manages the document scanning user experience in iOS applications. This component handles camera preview, document detection, user guidance, and scanning state transitions.

BlinkIDUXModel serves as the business logic layer for the document scanning interface. It is designed as a MainActor to ensure thread-safe UI updates and implements the ObservableObject protocol for SwiftUI integration. The model manages the entire scanning workflow, from camera initialization to document capture and verification.

#### Key Features

##### Camera Management

The model offers comprehensive camera control functionality through seamless integration with AVFoundation. It includes a fully implemented camera session, ensuring thread-safe access and synchronization with the BlinkIDAnalyzer for reliable and efficient performance.

The camera system is designed to provide robust and user-friendly functionality, including:

- Automatic session management for effortless setup and teardown.
- Torch/flashlight control to adapt to various lighting conditions.
- Frame capture and analysis synchronization for real-time document processing.
- Orientation handling to ensure correct alignment regardless of device orientation.

```swift
public class ScanningViewModel<T>: ObservableObject, ScanningViewModelProtocol {
    let camera: Camera = Camera()
}
```

##### User Feedback

The model provides comprehensive user feedback mechanisms. The feedback features are designed to enhance user experience and guide users effectively throughout the document scanning process. These include:

- Visual guidance through reticle state management, helping users align documents accurately.
- Error messaging and recovery suggestions, providing clear instructions to resolve issues.
- Success animations and transitions, offering a smooth and engaging user experience upon successful scans.
- Accessibility announcements, ensuring inclusivity by providing auditory feedback for users with disabilities.
- Progress indicators, keeping users informed about the scanning status in real time.

```swift
@Published var reticleState: ReticleState = .front
```

The model features a sophisticated animation system designed to provide dynamic and engaging user feedback during the document scanning process. Key animations include:

- Document flip animations, guiding users to scan both sides of a document when required.
- Success indicators, visually confirming successful scans.
- Ripple effects, drawing attention to areas of interest during the scanning process.
- State transitions, ensuring smooth and intuitive changes between different scanning states.

#### Best Practices

When implementing the BlinkIDUXModel, it’s crucial to follow best practices to ensure smooth and efficient operation. Key considerations include:

- Implement proper error handling to manage all scanning states gracefully and provide a robust user experience.
- Monitor memory usage during extended scanning sessions to avoid potential performance bottlenecks or crashes.
- Clean up resources promptly when the scanning process is complete to maintain optimal app performance.
- Handle orientation changes appropriately to ensure consistent user experience across different device orientations.

### BlinkIDUXView

BlinkIDUXView is the main scanning interface component that combines camera functionality with user interaction elements. The view is designed to provide real-time feedback during the document scanning process while maintaining a clean and intuitive user interface.

The view is built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, where:

- The view (BlinkIDUXView) handles the UI layout and user interactions
- The view model (BlinkIDUXModel) manages the business logic and state
- The camera integration handles the document capture pipeline

#### Key Features

##### Camera Integration

The view incorporates a camera feed through the CameraView component and manages the entire capture pipeline, including:

- Automatic camera session management

- Dynamic text scaling
- Accessibility labels and hints
- Automatic announcements for state changes

### Best Practices

1. Always initialize the view with a properly configured view model
2. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
3. Monitor memory usage during extended scanning sessions
4. Handle orientation changes appropriately
5. Implement proper cleanup on view dismissal

## <a name="creating-custom-ux-component"></a> Creating custom UX component

You have the flexibility to create your own custom UX if needed. However, we strongly recommend following the implementations provided in this package as a foundation. Since the package is source-available, you can modify or extend the code directly within your project to tailor it to your specific requirements.

We also highly recommend using our built-in Camera and CameraView components, as they are fully optimized for performance and seamlessly integrated with the BlinkIDAnalyzer. However, if necessary, you can implement and use your own camera solution. 

### ViewModel Creation

To integrate the document scanning workflow effectively, you will start by creating a ViewModel to manage the scanning logic and interface with the underlying components. The ViewModel acts as the bridge between the CameraFrameAnalyzer and your UI, handling data flow, state management, and event processing.

In this section, we will guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the ViewModel, integrating it with the camera and analyzer components, and linking it to your SwiftUI view. This approach ensures a modular and maintainable architecture while leveraging the optimized components provided by the SDK.

```swift
@MainActor
public final class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // Use our Camera controller
    let camera: Camera = Camera()
    let analyzer: CameraFrameAnalyzer
    // Instructions text for the View
    @Published var instructionText: String = "Scan the front side"
    // Published BlinkIDCaptureResult, use it in your ViewModel, or directly in your SwiftUI View
    @Published public var captureResult: BlinkIDCaptureResult?

    private var eventHandlingTask: Task<Void, Never>?

    public init(analyzer: CameraFrameAnalyzer) {
        self.analyzer = analyzer
        startEventHandling()
    }
```

The `startEventHandling` method initializes an event task, allowing you to receive and process UIEvents from the CameraFrameAnalyzer’s event stream. 

```swift
private func startEventHandling() {
    eventHandlingTask = Task {
        for await events in await analyzer.events.stream {
            if events.contains(.requestDocumentSide(side: .back)) {
            } else if events.contains(.requestDocumentSide(side: .barcode)) {
            } else if events.contains(.wrongSide) {
                instructionText = "Flip the document"
            } else if events.contains(.tooClose) {
                instructionText = "Move farther"
            } else if events.contains(.tooFar) {
                instructionText = "Move closer"
            } else if events.contains(.tooCloseToEdge) {
                instructionText = "Move farther"
            } else if events.contains(.tilt) {
                instructionText = "Keep document parallel with the phone"
            } else if events.contains(.blur) {
                instructionText = "Keep document and phone still"
            } else if events.contains(.glare) {
                instructionText = "Tilt or move document to remove reflection"
            } else if events.contains(.notFullyVisible) {
                instructionText = "Keep document fully visible"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Implement `analyze` and `pauseScanning` methods:

```swift
public func analyze() async {
    
    Task {
        let result = await analyzer.result()
        if let scanningResult = result as? ScanningResult<BlinkIDScanningResult, BlinkIDScanningAlertType> {
            switch scanningResult {
            case .completed(let scanningResult):
                finishScan()
                self.result = BlinkIDResultState(scanningResult: scanningResult)
            case .interrupted(let alertType):
                self.alertType = alertType
                showScanningAlert = true
            case .cancelled:
                showLicenseErrorAlert = true
            case .ended:
                self.result = BlinkIDResultState(scanningResult: nil)
            }
        }
    }
    
    for await frame in await camera.sampleBuffer {
        await analyzer.analyze(image: CameraFrame(buffer: frame.buffer, roi: roi, orientation: camera.orientation.toCameraFrameVideoOrientation()))
    }
}
```

```swift
func pauseScanning() {
    Task {
        await analyzer.cancel()
    }
}
```

#### CameraFrameAnalyzer

The CameraFrameAnalyzer protocol defines the core interface for components that analyze camera frames during document scanning operations. This protocol is designed to provide a standardized way of processing camera input while maintaining thread safety through Swift's concurrency system.

The protocol defines essential methods and properties for analyzing camera frames in real-time, managing the analysis lifecycle, and providing feedback through an event stream.

```swift
public protocol CameraFrameAnalyzer: Sendable {
    func analyze(image: CameraFrame) async
    func cancel() async
    func pause() async
    func resume() async
    func restart() async throws
    func end() async
    func result() async -> ScanningResult
    var events: EventStream { get }
}
```

##### Requirements

```swift
analyze(image: CameraFrame) async
```

Processes a single camera frame for analysis. This method operates asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread during intensive image processing operations.

```swift
cancel() async
```
Terminates the current analysis operation immediately. This method ensures proper cleanup of resources when analysis needs to be stopped before completion.

```swift
pause() async
```
Temporarily suspends the analysis operation while maintaining the current state. This is useful for scenarios where analysis needs to be temporarily halted, such as when the app enters the background.

```swift
resume() async
```
Continues a previously paused analysis operation. This method restores the analyzer to its active state and resumes processing frames.

```swift
restart() async throws
```
Starts a new analysis operation. This method resets the analyzer to its initial state and resumes processing frames.

```swift
end() async
```
Ends the analysis operation. This is used when analysis needs to be stopped, such as when the cancel button is pressed.

```swift
result() async -> ScanningResult
```
Retrieves the final result of the analysis operation. This method returns a ScanningResult object containing the analysis outcome.

```swift
events: EventStream
```
Provides access to a stream of UI events generated during the analysis process. This stream can be used to update the user interface based on analysis progress and findings.

> We strongly recommend using our `BlinkIDAnalyzer` for seamless integration. However, you can create your own custom implementation as long as it conforms to the `CameraFrameAnalyzer` protocol.

### View Creation

Once the ViewModel is set up and configured, the next step is to create a SwiftUI view that interacts with it. The ViewModel serves as the central point for managing the document scanning workflow, including handling events, processing results, and updating the UI state. By linking the ViewModel to your view, you can create a dynamic and responsive interface that provides real-time feedback to users. In this section, we will demonstrate how to build a SwiftUI view using the ViewModel, ensuring seamless integration with the underlying document scanning components.

Start by creating new SwiftUI View called CaptureView. 

```swift
struct CaptureView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var viewModel: ViewModel

    init(viewModel: ViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
    }
}
```

We need to add CameraView to our body:

```swift
var body: some View {
    GeometryReader { geometry in
    ZStack {
        CameraView(camera: viewModel.camera)
            .ignoresSafeArea()
            .statusBarHidden()
            .task {
                await viewModel.camera.start()
                await viewModel.analyze()
            }
            .onDisappear {
                viewModel.stopEventHandling()
                Task {
                    await viewModel.camera.stop()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The camera feed is displayed using CameraView, which is tightly integrated with the ViewModel’s camera property. The .task modifier ensures that the camera starts and begins analysis as soon as the view appears, and proper cleanup is handled in onDisappear to stop the camera and event handling gracefully.

We also need to add some instuction view to our ZStack that will connect our ViewModel's `instructionText`:

```swift
VStack {
    Spacer()

    // Text is in the middle of the screen     
    Text(viewModel.instructionText)
        .font(.system(size: 20))
        .foregroundColor(Color.white)
        .padding()
        .background(Color.gray)
        .clipShape(.capsule)
    
    Spacer()
}
```

### Connecting ViewModel and View

In this section, we will demonstrate how to establish the connection between the ViewModel and the View to facilitate a seamless document scanning workflow:

```swift
let analyzer = await BlinkIDAnalyzer(
    sdk: localSdk,
    eventStream: BlinkIDEventStream()
)

let viewModel = ViewModel(analyzer: analyzer)
```

In your SwiftUI View, add CaptureView:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CaptureView(viewModel: viewModel)
    }
}
```

And that's it! You have created a custom SwiftUI View and ViewModel!

## <a name="localization"></a> Localization

Our app supports localization following Apple’s recommended approach. We provide a `Localizable.xcstrings` file that you can use or modify as needed. Localization is determined by the system settings, meaning you must define 
supported languages in your app’s `Info.plist` under the `Localizations` key, ensuring all required keys are included. Once configured, users can change the app’s language via Settings > [App Name] > Language. Note that in-app 
language switching is not supported, as we adhere to Apple’s intended localization flow.

### <a name="custom-translations"></a> Providing your own translations

If you want to override some or all of the SDK's built-in strings — for example to change the wording, or to ship a language we don't provide out of the box — you can point the SDK at your own translations bundle through the theme.

Add the keys you want to override (the SDK's string keys are prefixed with `mb_`, e.g. `mb_back_instructions`) to your app's `Localizable.xcstrings` (or a dedicated `.strings`/`.stringsdict` table), then configure the theme before presenting the scanning UI:

```swift
import BlinkIDUX

// Load overrides from your app's main bundle.
BlinkIDTheme.shared.localizationBundle = .main

// Optional: if your overrides live in a dedicated table (e.g. BlinkIDStrings.xcstrings),
// set its name here. Leave it as nil to use the default `Localizable` table.
BlinkIDTheme.shared.localizationTableName = "BlinkIDStrings"
```

For every string, the SDK first looks up the key in `localizationBundle` and falls back to its own built-in translation when the key isn't found — so you only need to provide the strings you actually want to change. Set `localizationBundle` back to `nil` to restore the SDK's own translations.

### <a name="forcing-a-language"></a> Forcing a specific language (in-app language switching)

By default the SDK follows the device's system language. If you want to display the scanning UI in a specific language regardless of the device settings — for example to let users switch language from within your app — set the language on the theme:

```swift
import BlinkIDUX

BlinkIDTheme.shared.language = "de"   // force German
// BlinkIDTheme.shared.language = nil // follow the system language (default)
```

The language must be present in the SDK's bundled translations (or in your `localizationBundle`); if it isn't, the SDK falls back to the system language. Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew, …) automatically flip the scanning UI's layout direction.

Configure this **before presenting the scanning UI** — SwiftUI does not re-render an already-visible scanning screen when the value changes, so set it prior to launching a new scan.

## <a name="sdk-integration-troubleshooting"></a> SDK Integration Troubleshooting

In case of problems with using the SDK, you should do as follows:

### <a name="troubleshooting-licensing-problems"></a> Licensing problems

If you are getting "invalid licence key" error or having other licence-related problems (e.g. some feature is not enabled that should be or there is a watermark on top of camera), first check the console. All licence-related problems are logged to error log so it is easy to determine what went wrong.

When you have determine what is the licence-relate problem or you simply do not understand the log, you should contact us [help.microblink.com](http://help.microblink.com). When contacting us, please make sure you provide following information:

* exact Bundle ID of your app (from your `info.plist` file)
* licence that is causing problems
* please stress out that you are reporting problem related to iOS version of BlinkID SDK
* if unsure about the problem, you should also provide excerpt from console containing licence error

### <a name="troubleshooting-other-problems"></a> Other problems

If you are having problems with scanning certain items, undesired behaviour on specific device(s), crashes inside BlinkID SDK or anything unmentioned, please do as follows:
	
* Contact us at [help.microblink.com](http://help.microblink.com) describing your problem and provide following information:
	* log file obtained in previous step
	* high resolution scan/photo of the item that you are trying to scan
	* information about device that you are using
	* please stress out that you are reporting problem related to iOS version of BlinkID SDK

# <a name="blinkid-sdk-size"></a> BlinkID SDK size

BlinkID is really lightweight SDK. Compressed size is just **2.4MB**. SDK size calculation is done by [creating an App Size Report with Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/reducing-your-app-s-size), one with and one without the SDK.
Here is the SDK *App Size Report* for iPhone:

| Size | App + On Demand Resources size | App size |
| --- |:-------------:| :----------------:|
| compressed | 2.4 MB | 2.4 MB |
| uncompressed | 5.5 MB | 5.5 MB |

The uncompressed size is equivalent to the size of the installed app on the device, and the compressed size is the download size of your app.
You can find the *App Size Report* [here](https://github.com/microblink/blinkid-ios/tree/master/size-report).
